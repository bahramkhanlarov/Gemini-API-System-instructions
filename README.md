# Gemini-API-System-instructions
System instructions allow you to steer the behavior of the model. By setting the system instruction, you are giving the model additional context to understand the task, provide more customized responses, and adhere to guidelines over the user interaction. Product-level behavior can be specified here, separate from prompts provided by end users.
